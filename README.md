⚡ Warsaw EV Infrastructure Analysis — SQL + Power BI Project

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Warsaw’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network to evaluate infrastructure readiness, charging demand, customer behavior, and revenue performance across districts. The goal is to uncover insights that support data-driven decisions for EV infrastructure expansion.

🎯 Objectives
Identify high-demand charging locations
Assess whether current infrastructure supports projected EV growth
Analyze charging behavior across income tiers
Evaluate revenue performance of charging stations
Highlight gaps for future infrastructure planning

📊 Datasets Used
districts.csv — District information and income tiers
charging_stations.csv — Station details and plug counts
charging_sessions.csv — Charging usage data
customers.csv — Customer demographics and vehicle info

🛠 Tools & Technologies
SQL (Data analysis and querying)
Power BI (Dashboard and visualization)
Excel / CSV (Data source)

🧮 SQL Analysis
Performed 14 queries covering:
**Basic**
District overview
Station and plug counts
Total sessions and average energy
**Intermediate**
Energy and revenue by district
Top stations
Cost and customer analysis
**Advanced**
EV demand vs infrastructure comparison
Gap identification
Infrastructure readiness ranking
Each query includes insights explaining key findings.

📈 Power BI Dashboard (4 Pages)
1️⃣ EV Infrastructure Overview
Stations, plugs, coverage, infrastructure split
2️⃣ Charging Usage & Demand
Sessions, energy consumption, peak usage patterns
3️⃣ Customer Behavior Analysis
Customer segments, vehicle usage, consumption trends
4️⃣ Revenue & Planning Insights
Revenue distribution, cost analysis, gap analysi
Filters include District, Income Tier, and Charging Station.

🔍 Key Insights
High demand concentrated in specific districts
Mid-income customers drive most usage and revenue
Infrastructure gaps exist where EV growth exceeds plug availability
Peak demand occurs during daytime hours
Revenue strongly correlates with station utilization

💡 Recommendations
Expand infrastructure in high-demand districts
Increase capacity in mid-income areas
Optimize underutilized stations
Plan expansion using demand projections
Introduce programs for high-usage customers

🚀 Business Impact
This analysis helps city planners and EV operators make informed decisions to improve charging accessibility, reduce congestion, and support sustainable EV adoption.
